## Contributing

We greatly value the feedback and contributions of our users.

We keep a distinction between Bugs/Issues, New Features and Support Requests. We also try to minimise the noise in our GitHub Issues stream and prefer having a conversation on [BLIMAN Slack](https://slack.be-secure.io) before creating new issues, if you are not fully sure how to categorize your request. Simply sign up and join one of the following channels:

- User Issues can be raised in our [User Issues channel](https://be-secure.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=user-issues).
- New Features or Enhancements can be discussed in our [CLI Development channel](https://be-secure.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=cli-development).

The [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/be-secure/BeSlabman/issues/new) provides templates for required information.

**Unfortunately we might simply close any GitHub Issues that have not followed the requested template.**

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are _always_ very welcome, but require a valid GitHub Issue as described above. The PR template is to be filled in before submission, ensuring that it is _linked back_ to the GitHub Issue number by replacing `#XXX` with the appropriate issue reference.

Each PR should also be accompanied by a passing test(s) proving its validity (where feasible). The feasibility of the test will emerge in the initial discussions of the issue.
