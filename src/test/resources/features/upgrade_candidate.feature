Feature: Upgrade Candidate

	Background:
		Given the internet is reachable
		And the candidates cache is initialised with "grails"
		And an initialised environment

	Scenario: Display upgradable candidate version in use when it is upgradable
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "2.4.4"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade grails" and answer "n"
		Then I see "Available defaults:"
		And I see "grails (local: 1.3.9; default: 2.4.4)"

	Scenario: Display upgradable candidate version in use when it is not upgradable
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "1.3.9"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade grails"
		Then I see "grails is up-to-date"

	Scenario: Display upgradable candidate version when none is in use
		Given the candidate "grails" does not exist locally
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade grails"
		Then I see "Not using any version of grails"

	Scenario: Display upgradable candidate versions when none is specified and none is in use
		Given the candidate "grails" does not exist locally
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade"
		Then I see "No candidates are in use"

	Scenario: Display upgradable candidate versions when none is specified and one is in use
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "2.4.4"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade" and answer "n"
		Then I see "Available defaults:"
		And I see "grails (local: 1.3.9; default: 2.4.4)"

	Scenario: Display upgradable candidate versions when none is specified and multiple are in use
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "2.4.4"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.5" is already installed and default
		And the default "groovy" version is "2.4.1"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade" and answer "n"
		Then I see "Available defaults:"
		And I see "grails (local: 1.3.9; default: 2.4.4)"
		And I see "groovy (local: 2.0.5; default: 2.4.1)"

	Scenario: Display upgradable candidate versions when none specified and multiple in use but not upgradable
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "1.3.9"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.5" is already installed and default
		And the default "groovy" version is "2.0.5"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade"
		Then I see "All candidates are up-to-date"

	Scenario: Update all upgradable candidates versions and set them as default
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "2.1.0"
		And the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is available for download
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.5" is already installed and default
		And the default "groovy" version is "2.4.1"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.4.1" is available for download
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade" and answer "Y"
		Then I see "Available defaults:"
		And I see "grails (local: 1.3.9; default: 2.1.0)"
		And I see "groovy (local: 2.0.5; default: 2.4.1)"
		And I see "Use prescribed default version(s)? (Y/n)"
		And I do not see "Do you want grails 2.1.0 to be set as default? (Y/n)"
		And I see "Setting grails 2.1.0 as default."
		And I do not see "Do you want groovy 2.4.1 to be set as default? (Y/n)"
		And I see "Setting groovy 2.4.1 as default."
		Then the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" should be the default
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.4.1" should be the default

	Scenario: Don't update all upgradable candidates versions and set them as default
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "2.1.0"
		And the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is available for download
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade" and answer "N"
		Then I see "Available defaults:"
		And I see "grails (local: 1.3.9; default: 2.1.0)"
		And I see "Use prescribed default version(s)? (Y/n)"
		Then the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" should be the default

	Scenario: Update upgradable candidate version and set it as default
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "2.1.0"
		And the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is available for download
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade grails" and answer "Y"
		Then I see "Available defaults:"
		And I see "grails (local: 1.3.9; default: 2.1.0)"
		And I see "Use prescribed default version(s)? (Y/n): "
		And I do not see "Do you want grails 2.1.0 to be set as default? (Y/n)"
		And I see "Setting grails 2.1.0 as default."
		Then the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" should be the default

	Scenario: Update upgradable candidate version and auto-answer to make it default
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "2.1.0"
		And the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is available for download
		And I have configured "bliman_auto_answer" to "true"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli upgrade grails"
		Then I see "Available defaults:"
		And I see "grails (local: 1.3.9; default: 2.1.0)"
		And I do not see "Use prescribed default version(s)? (Y/n): "
		And I do not see "Do you want grails 2.1.0 to be set as default? (Y/n)"
		And I see "Setting grails 2.1.0 as default."
		Then the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" should be the default

	Scenario: Don't update upgradable candidate version and set it as default
		Given the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is already installed and default
		And the default "grails" version is "2.1.0"
		And the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is available for download
		And the system is bootstrapped

		Then I see "Available defaults:"
		And I see "grails (local: 1.3.9; default: 2.1.0)"
		And I see "Use prescribed default version(s)? (Y/n)"
		Then the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" should be the default
