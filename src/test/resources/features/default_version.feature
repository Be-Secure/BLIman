		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.5" is a valid candidate version
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli default groovy 2.0.5"
		Then I see "Stop! Candidate version is not installed."
		And I see "Tip: Run the following to install this version"
		And I see "$ bli install groovy 2.0.5"

	Scenario: Default a candidate version that is installed and not default
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.5" is a valid candidate version
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.5" is already installed but not default
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli default groovy 2.0.5"
		Then I see "Default groovy version set to 2.0.5"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.5" should be the default

	Scenario: Default a candidate version that is installed and already default
