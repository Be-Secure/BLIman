Feature: Local Development Versions

	Background:
		Given the internet is reachable
		And an initialised environment

	Scenario: Install a new local development version
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not available for download
		And I have a local candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" at "/tmp/groovy-core"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli install groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT /tmp/groovy-core"
		Then I see "Linking groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT to /tmp/groovy-core"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is linked to "/tmp/groovy-core"

	Scenario: Attempt installing a local development version that already exists
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not available for download
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is already linked to "/tmp/groovy-core"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli install groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT /tmp/groovy-core"
		Then I see "groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT is already installed."
		And the exit code is 0
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is linked to "/tmp/groovy-core"

	Scenario: Uninstall a local development version
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is already linked to "/tmp/groovy-core"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli uninstall groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT"
		Then I see "Uninstalling groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not installed

	Scenario: Attempt uninstalling a local development version that is not installed
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not installed
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli uninstall groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT"
		Then I see "groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT is not installed."

	Scenario: Make the local development version the default for the candidate
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.6" is already installed and default
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not available for download
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is already linked to "/tmp/groovy-core"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli default groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT"
		Then I see "Default groovy version set to 2.1-SNAPSHOT"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" should be the default

	Scenario: Use a local development version
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.0.6" is already installed and default
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not available for download
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is already linked to "/tmp/groovy-core"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli use groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT"
		Then I see "Using groovy version 2.1-SNAPSHOT in this shell"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" should be in use

	Scenario: Install a local development version from a valid relative path
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not available for download
		And I have a local candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" at relative path "some/relative/path/to/groovy"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli install groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT some/relative/path/to/groovy"
		Then I see "Linking groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is linked to the relative path "some/relative/path/to/groovy"

	Scenario: Prevent installation of a local development version for an invalid path
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not available for download
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli install groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT /some/bogus/path/to/groovy"
		Then I see "Invalid path! Refusing to link groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT to /some/bogus/path/to/groovy."
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT" is not installed

	Scenario: Prevent installation of a local development version for a long version
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOTLONG" is not available for download
		And I have a local candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOTLONG" at relative path "some/relative/path/to/groovy"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli install groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOTLONG some/relative/path/to/groovy"
		Then I see "Invalid version! 2.1-SNAPSHOTLONG with length 16 exceeds max of 15!"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOTLONG" is not installed

	Scenario: Allow installation of a local development version for longest possible version
		Given the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT-XX" is not available for download
		And I have a local candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT-XX" at "/tmp/groovy-core"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli install groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT-XX /tmp/groovy-core"
		Then I see "Linking groovy 2.1-SNAPSHOT-XX to /tmp/groovy-core"
		And the candidate "groovy" version "2.1-SNAPSHOT-XX" is linked to "/tmp/groovy-core"

	Scenario: Allow installation of a local development version for a short version
		Given the candidate "java" version "graal" is not available for download
		And I have a local candidate "java" version "graal" at "/tmp/graalvm-1.0.0-rc4-graal"
		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli install java graal /tmp/graalvm-1.0.0-rc4-graal"
		Then I see "Linking java graal to /tmp/graalvm-1.0.0-rc4-graal"
		And the candidate "java" version "graal" is linked to "/tmp/graalvm-1.0.0-rc4-graal"
