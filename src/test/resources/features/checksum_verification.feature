Feature: Verify checksums

	Background:
		Given the internet is reachable
		And an initialised environment
		And I have configured "bliman_checksum_enable" to "true"

	Scenario: Install a specific Version with a valid SHA-256 checksum
		Given the system is bootstrapped
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is available for download with checksum "1f9234c8e622ec46d33883ea45b39ede768b92d478fe08f6952548247f7fbb65" using algorithm "SHA-256"
		When I enter "bli install grails 1.3.9"
		Then I see "Done installing!"
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is installed
		And the response headers file is created for candidate "grails" and version "1.3.9"
		And the exit code is 0

	Scenario: Install a specific Version with a valid SHA1 checksum
		Given the system is bootstrapped
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is available for download with checksum "c68e386a6deec9fc4c1e18df21f92739ba2ab36e" using algorithm "SHA1"
		When I enter "bli install grails 1.3.9"
		Then I see "Done installing!"
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is installed
		And the response headers file is created for candidate "grails" and version "1.3.9"
		And the exit code is 0

	Scenario: Install a specific Version with a valid MD5 checksum
		Given the system is bootstrapped
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is available for download with checksum "1e87a7d982a2f41da96fdec289908552" using algorithm "MD5"
		When I enter "bli install grails 1.3.9"
		Then I see "Done installing!"
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is installed
		And the response headers file is created for candidate "grails" and version "1.3.9"
		And the exit code is 0

	Scenario: Do not fail if an unknown algorithm is used
		Given the system is bootstrapped
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is available for download with checksum "abc-checksum-00000" using algorithm "ABC"
		When I enter "bli install grails 1.3.9"
		Then I see "Done installing!"
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is installed
		And the response headers file is created for candidate "grails" and version "1.3.9"
		And the exit code is 0

	Scenario: Do not fail if no algorithm is detected
		Given the system is bootstrapped
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is available for download
		When I enter "bli install grails 1.3.9"
		Then I see "Done installing!"
		And I do not see "Stop! An invalid checksum was detected and the archive removed! Please try re-installing."
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is installed
		And the response headers file is created for candidate "grails" and version "1.3.9"
		And the exit code is 0

	Scenario: Do not fail if checksums are disabled
		Given the system is bootstrapped
		And I have configured "bliman_checksum_enable" to "false"
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is available for download with checksum "abc-checksum-00000" using algorithm "SHA-256"
		When I enter "bli install grails 1.3.9"
		Then I see "Checksums are disabled, skipping verification"
		And I see "Done installing!"
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is installed
		And the response headers file is created for candidate "grails" and version "1.3.9"
		And the exit code is 0

	Scenario: Abort installation after download of a binary with invalid SHA checksum
		Given the system is bootstrapped
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is available for download with checksum "c68e386a6deec9fc4c1e18df21f927000000000e" using algorithm "SHA-256"
		When I enter "bli install grails 1.3.9"
		Then I see "Stop! An invalid checksum was detected and the archive removed! Please try re-installing."
		And the candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is not installed
		And the archive for candidate "grails" version "1.3.9" is removed
		And the exit code is 1
