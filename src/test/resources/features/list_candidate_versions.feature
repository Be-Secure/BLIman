		And the system is bootstrapped
		When I enter "bli list grails"
		Then I see "Candidate: grails"

	Scenario: List an installed available Version not in use
		Given the candidate "grails" version "2.1.0" is already installed but not default
		And the candidate "grails" has a version list available
